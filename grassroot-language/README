This module is based on Natty, a natural language date parser written in Java.
Natty's principal author is Joe Stelmach, and in its original form can be found
here: http://natty.joestelmach.com.

The module included here has made some changes in Natty's grammar to handle
date and time formats by our users, the most noticeable such change being
that days tend to precede months, rather than vice versa.

The Natty license is included here as "LICENSE".
